# SDK spec overlays
#
# Purpose:
# - Add a small set of SDK-only endpoints that are not yet present in the main bundled spec.
# - Keep the repo's main bundled spec (dist/paystack.yaml) as the primary source.
#
# This file is intentionally minimal: only SDK-only paths live here.
# The merged SDK spec output is written to src/assets/sdk/paystack.yaml and synced to each
# sdks/*/openapi.yaml.

# No SDK-only overrides are currently required.
